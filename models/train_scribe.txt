Models will get saved here. By popular request:

  I just put several trained models in my public directory. You can wget them with

  wget http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/~sgreydan/scribe/models/$FILENAME

  where filename could be any of: [checkpoint model.ckpt-129000 model.ckpt-129000.meta model.ckpt-40000 model.ckpt-40000.meta model.ckpt-66500 model.ckpt-66500.meta]

  Make sure you set your model_checkpoint_path: “model.ckpt-XXXX” where ‘XXXX’ is the checkpoint you want to load.

  I can’t remember which of these trained models is the best. Also, the "You know nothing Jon Snow" example was generated before I made some significant edits to the code (renaming scopes, etc.) so that trained model won't work. However, you should get mostly legible results even with the 66500 model - a good place to start
